# Overview

## Home

An integrated suite of high-performance \(big data\) applications for the management and analysis of population-scale genomic data.

![OpenCB Summary](http://docs.opencb.org/download/thumbnails/327710/image2020-8-13_18-25-38.png?version=1&modificationDate=1597335938379&api=v2)

**By replacing datafiles with databases our software promotes:**

* Scalability; the ability to run queries in real-time across hundreds of thousands of genomes.
* Accessibility; the ability to analyse from anywhere on the web without needing access to the local filesystem.
* Integration; the ability to link data together using flexible data models covering reference data, variant data and clinical metadata.
* Security; the ability to protect data using federated \(e.g. SSO\) authentication and role-based authorisation schemes. 

**OpenCB solutions are typically used as:**

* The storage target of secondary analysis pipelines.
* The data source for tertiary analysis workflows.

**The open-source OpenCB software is developed and maintained by researchers from multiple organisations and made freely available at https://github.com/opencb**

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
